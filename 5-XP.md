# XP and Embracing Change
It’s a long-accepted part of programmer culture: users never ask for what they actually want, and they make your life hard when they change their minds all the time. Developers know from experience that when you have to make changes to code that was already written, it causes bugs. The more changes developers need to make, the more brittle the codebase gets.

XP (or Extreme Programming) is an agile methodology. And just like Scrum, it’s made up of practices, values, and principles. You’ll learn how XP can help get each team member into the right mindset to build better code: instead of hating change, every person on the team learns to embrace change.
