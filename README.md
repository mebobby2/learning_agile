# Learning Agile

The goal of this book is to help you learn both sides of agile: the practices that make up the day-to-day work, and the values and principles that help you and your team fundamen‐ tally change the way that you think about building software.

## What Is Agile?
Agile is a set of methods and methodologies that help your team to think more effectively, work more efficiently, and make better decisions.

These methods and methodologies address all of the areas of traditional software engineering, including project management, software design and architecture, and process improvement.

Agile is also a mindset, because the right mindset can make a big difference in how effectively a team uses the practices. This mindset helps people on a team share information with one another, so that they can make important project decisions together —instead of having a manager who makes all of those decisions alone. An agile mindset is about opening up planning, design, and process improvement to the entire team. An agile team uses practices in a way where everyone shares the same information, and each person on the team has a say in how the practices are applied.
