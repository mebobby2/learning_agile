# Scrum
Here’s the basic pattern for a Scrum project:
* There are three main roles on a Scrum project: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **team member**
* The Product Owner works with the rest of the team to maintain and prioritize a **product backlog** of features and requirements that need to be built
* The software is built using timeboxed iterations called **sprints**. At the start of each sprint, the team does **sprint planning** to determine which features from the backlog they will build. This is called the **sprint backlog**, and the team works throughout the sprint to build all of the features in it.
* Every day, the team holds a short face-to-face meeting called the **Daily Scrum** to update each other on the progress they’ve made, and to discuss the roadblocks ahead. Each person answers three questions: What have I done since the last Daily Scrum? What will I do until the next Daily Scrum? What roadblocks are in my way?
* One person, the Scrum Master, keeps the project rolling by working with the team to get past roadblocks that they’ve identified and asked for help with. At the end of the sprint, working software is demonstrated to the product owner and stakeholders in the **sprint review**, and the team holds a **retrospective** to figure out lessons they’ve learned, so they can improve the way they run their sprints and build software in the future.

But for a Scrum team to become effective, they need to do more than just follow the basic Scrum pattern. Effective Scrum teams are **self-organizing**:

For Scrum to work, the team has to deeply and viscerally understand *collective commitment* and *self-organization*. Scrum’s theory, practices, and rules are easy to grasp intel‐ lectually. But until a group of individuals has made a collective commitment to deliver something tangible in a fixed amount of time, those individuals probably don’t get Scrum. When the team members stop acting as many and adopt and commit to a com‐ mon purpose, the team becomes capable of self-organization and can quickly cut through complexity and produce actionable plans.

## The Rules of Scrum
* Each sprint starts with sprint planning done by the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and the rest of the team, consisting of a meeting divided into two parts, each timeboxed to four hours. The Product Owner’s homework prior to sprint planning is to come up with a prioritized backlog for the product that consists of a set of items that the users and stakeholders have bought into. In the first part of the meeting, the Product Owner works with the team to select items that will be delivered at the end of the sprint based on their value and on the team’s estimate of how much work they will be. The team agrees to give a demo of working soft‐ ware that includes those items at the end of the sprint. This first part is time‐ boxed (for a 30-day sprint it’s timeboxed to four hours; for shorter sprints, it’s proportionately shorter) so at the end the team takes whatever they’ve come up with so far and uses that as the sprint backlog. In the second part of the meeting, the team members (with the Product Owner’s help) figure out the individual tasks they’ll use to actually implement those items. Again, this part is timeboxed based on the length of the sprint (but often takes less time than that). At the end of sprint planning, the items they’ve selected become the sprint backlog.
* The team holds a Daily Scrum meeting every day. All team members (including the Scrum Master and Product Owner) must attend, and interested stakeholders may attend as well (but must remain silent observers). The meeting is timeboxed to 15 minutes, so all team members must show up on time. Every team member answers three questions: What have I done since the last Daily Scrum? What will I do between now and the next Daily Scrum? What obstacles and roadblocks are in my way? Each team member must be brief; if an answer requires discussion, the relevant team members schedule a follow-up for immediately after the meeting.
* Each sprint is timeboxed to a specific length decided during sprint planning: many teams use 30 calendar days, but this length can vary—some teams choose two-week sprints, some choose one month (and again, the planning timebox should vary accordingly). During the sprint, the team builds the items in the sprint backlog into working software. They can get help from people who are not on the team, but people who are not on the team cannot tell the team how to do their jobs, and must trust the team to deliver. If anyone on the team discovers partway through the sprint that they overcommitted or that they can add extra items, they need to make sure the Product Owner knows as soon as they realize the sprint is in danger. He’s the team member who can work with the users and stakeholders to reset their expectations, and use that information to adjust the sprint backlog to match the team’s actual capacity. And if they find that they’ll run out of work before the sprint ends, they can add more items to the sprint backlog. The team must keep the sprint backlog up to date and visible to every‐ one. In very abnormal cases and extreme circumstances, the Product Owner can terminate the sprint early and initiate new sprint planning if the team discovers that they cannot deliver working software (e.g., a serious technology, organiza‐ tional, or staffing issue comes up). But everyone needs to know that terminating the sprint is rare, and has an extremely negative cost in terms of their ability to produce and deliver software, and seriously impacts the trust that they’ve built up with their users and stakeholders.
* At the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review meeting where they demonstrate working software to users and stakeholders. The demo may only include items that are actually done done3 (which, in this case, means that the team has finished all work on it and tested it, and that it’s been accepted by the Product Owner as complete). The team can only present functional, working software, not intermediate items like architecture diagrams, database schemas, functional specs, etc. Stakeholders can ask questions, which the team can answer. At the end of the demo, the stakeholders are asked for their opinions and feed‐ back, and are given the opportunity to share their thoughts, feelings, ideas, and opinions. If changes are needed, that’s taken into account when the next sprint is planned. The Product Owner can add the changes to the product backlog, and if they need to be made immediately they’ll end up in the sprint backlog for the next sprint.
* After the sprint, the team holds a sprint retrospective meeting to find specific ways to improve how they work. The team and Scrum Master (and optionally the Product Owner) attend. Each person answers two questions: What went well during the sprint? What can improve in the future? The Scrum Master takes note of any improvements, and specific items (such as setting up a new build server, adopting a new programming practice, or changing the office layout) are added to the product backlog as nonfunctional items.

## Everyone on a Scrum Team Owns the Project
When the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and team start to work together instead of separately, the project begins to look more like Scrum.

### The Scrum Master Guides the Team’s Decisions
On a command-and-control project, the project manager is the owner and main‐ tainer of the schedule and plan. He talks to the stakeholders, gets the requirements, breaks down the work, obtains estimates from the team, assigns tasks, and builds out a schedule.

Team members on a command-and-control project have a natural CYA urge to wash their hands of project problems when they’re caused by someone else’s plan.

That’s one reason why Scrum doesn’t have a separate role for a person who owns the plan. So the Scrum Master doesn’t own the plan. He may help the team to create the plan. But more importantly, he guides the team’s use of Scrum and its practices, and helps everyone feel like they own the plan together.

### The Product Owner Helps the Team Understand the Value of the Software
On a Scrum team, the Product Owner is the person who made the commitment to the company. He’s the person who has to stand up and promise something specific that will be delivered at the end of the project. The Product Owner is keyed into the real business goals that the project is meant to fulfill. The more effectively he can get the team to understand those goals and feel committed to meeting them, the better the project will go. And when the project inevitably runs into trouble like technical problems, a change in the business, or people leaving the team, the Product Owner has to find a way to keep the team’s understanding of goals current, and keep up their feeling of commitment. He makes day-to-day decisions based on business changes, and meets with the team every day to make sure they understand how the backlog and the goals of the project are changing.

The Product Owner doesn’t just sit around and wait for the sprint to finish. The Product Owner’s job is to own and prioritize the backlog, to be the voice of the business to the team, to help them understand what stories and backlog items are most important and most valuable, and to make sure that everyone understands what it means to be done done with a backlog item.

The Product Owner has a very active day-to-day role in the project. The sprint planning that happens at the beginning of the sprint gives everyone enough information to get started, but that’s not nearly enough time for the Product Owner to communicate to the entire team all of the details about what they’ll be building. So during the sprint, the Product Owner works with all of the team members every single day, answering lots of detailed questions and giving them specific answers about what they’ll be building and how users will use the features they’re working on, as well as making lots of small decisions about how the product will work.

The Product Owner has the authority to make these decisions. (If he doesn’t, he’s the wrong person for the job! Scrum depends on the ability of the Product Owner to make decisions on behalf of the business, including accepting completed work.)

### Everyone Owns the Project
How many times have you, as a developer, chosen a technology for the project just because you want to learn it? As a project manager, have you chosen to work on agile projects because it makes you more marketable? Probably. We’ve all done this, at least a little bit. Everyone’s self-motivated, and it’s important to recognize that. But one thing that Scrum is asking you to do is: while you’re working on a sprint, making the project successful is more important than any other professional goal that you have. In other words, keep being a pig when you’re on a Scrum team, and not a chicken!

However, Scrum teams—and especially their Product Owners—cultivate relationships with their chickens (For example, every user is a potential chicken.). One of the most effective ways that they have to do this is to release working software to their users on a regular and predictable schedule. This keeps the chickens involved, and helps them see the influence that they have over the project.

#### How Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and team members can be better pigs
When a team member just does the tasks that are assigned to him by a project manager, but doesn’t feel like it’s really his problem when the plan runs into trouble, he’s acting like a chicken.

The sad truth is that many companies expect team members to act like chickens, and not pigs. In fact, programmers often find that when they try to get involved with planning the project they’re pushed away from the process, because planning and decision making is a privilege reserved for managers, not rank-and-file programmers.

It’s far too easy for a Scrum Master to inadvertently encourage the team to be chick‐ ens by becoming the owner—or 'keeper'—of the plan. This is a very difficult habit to break for a command-and-control project manager who’s learning to become a Scrum Master. When the Scrum Master breaks down the work for a sprint by himself, goes and gets estimates from the team, assigns work to them, and checks up on their status, he’s acting like the 'keeper' of the plan. He’s also encouraging them to be chickens instead of pigs.

Correcting a chicken attitude among the team is one of the most difficult barriers to Scrum adoption that Scrum Masters face. Teams often embrace the role of the command-and-control project manager because it takes the burden of having to think about the whole project off of their shoulders.

A Scrum Master can help encourage team members to be pigs by treating estimates as facts that have yet to be uncovered, not commitments to be wrung from the team. An estimate for a task is a fact because the team will spend a certain amount of time doing the work. The best estimates are real attempts to tell the truth about what will happen, not pie-in-the-sky, hopeful guesses that are used to please or placate a man‐ ager, or get out of the planning meeting faster.

Traditional project managers often see the plan as a way to motivate the team, and commit them to a deadline. They often see the plan as a way to get the team to do something, as if the team will just sit around doing nothing if not for the plan. A project manager that wrings aggressive estimates from the team and 'ratifies' them at the start of the sprint will often feel comfortable using the plan later to bully the team. This is why an attitude of “plan the work, work the plan” can create a fracture between the project man‐ ager and the team.

On an effective Scrum team, instead of demanding estimates and then holding each person accountable for them, the Scrum Master works with the whole team in order to discover each estimate—not just the individual person assigned to do each task. A Scrum Master and team who work together to do the best job they can of predicting what will happen, and who keep working together throughout the project to keep that picture as accurate as possible, will give themselves the time to do the best work they can—and will end up delivering more valuable software as a result.

Team members also feel more committed when they participate in assigning the work during a sprint planning session, rather than having the work assigned to them. In fact, if the team members really feel that sense of commitment, the assignments don’t even need to be made at the start of the sprint. Effective Scrum teams can decide during the sprint who will do which tasks, based on which people are available and the skills that they can bring to the task. This is one of the keys to understanding how self-organizing teams work.

This means that on effective Scrum teams, the team members don’t just commit to their individual tasks. Every single person feels a genuine commitment to delivering the most valuable software they can to their users and stakeholders. When everyone on the team shares this feeling, and agrees to deliver working software at the end of each sprint, we say that the team has made a **collective commitment**. Instead of committing to individual, micro-level tasks in a plan, the team is committed to delivering valuable items in the backlog.

## Scrum Has Its Own Set of Values
