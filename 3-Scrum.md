# Scrum
Here’s the basic pattern for a Scrum project:
* There are three main roles on a Scrum project: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **team member**
* The Product Owner works with the rest of the team to maintain and prioritize a **product backlog** of features and requirements that need to be built
* The software is built using timeboxed iterations called **sprints**. At the start of each sprint, the team does **sprint planning** to determine which features from the backlog they will build. This is called the **sprint backlog**, and the team works throughout the sprint to build all of the features in it.
* Every day, the team holds a short face-to-face meeting called the **Daily Scrum** to update each other on the progress they’ve made, and to discuss the roadblocks ahead. Each person answers three questions: What have I done since the last Daily Scrum? What will I do until the next Daily Scrum? What roadblocks are in my way?
* One person, the Scrum Master, keeps the project rolling by working with the team to get past roadblocks that they’ve identified and asked for help with. At the end of the sprint, working software is demonstrated to the product owner and stakeholders in the **sprint review**, and the team holds a **retrospective** to figure out lessons they’ve learned, so they can improve the way they run their sprints and build software in the future.

But for a Scrum team to become effective, they need to do more than just follow the basic Scrum pattern. Effective Scrum teams are **self-organizing**:

For Scrum to work, the team has to deeply and viscerally understand *collective commitment* and *self-organization*. Scrum’s theory, practices, and rules are easy to grasp intel‐ lectually. But until a group of individuals has made a collective commitment to deliver something tangible in a fixed amount of time, those individuals probably don’t get Scrum. When the team members stop acting as many and adopt and commit to a com‐ mon purpose, the team becomes capable of self-organization and can quickly cut through complexity and produce actionable plans.

## The Rules of Scrum
* Each sprint starts with sprint planning done by the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and the rest of the team, consisting of a meeting divided into two parts, each timeboxed to four hours. The Product Owner’s homework prior to sprint planning is to come up with a prioritized backlog for the product that consists of a set of items that the users and stakeholders have bought into. In the first part of the meeting, the Product Owner works with the team to select items that will be delivered at the end of the sprint based on their value and on the team’s estimate of how much work they will be. The team agrees to give a demo of working soft‐ ware that includes those items at the end of the sprint. This first part is time‐ boxed (for a 30-day sprint it’s timeboxed to four hours; for shorter sprints, it’s proportionately shorter) so at the end the team takes whatever they’ve come up with so far and uses that as the sprint backlog. In the second part of the meeting, the team members (with the Product Owner’s help) figure out the individual tasks they’ll use to actually implement those items. Again, this part is timeboxed based on the length of the sprint (but often takes less time than that). At the end of sprint planning, the items they’ve selected become the sprint backlog.
* The team holds a Daily Scrum meeting every day. All team members (including the Scrum Master and Product Owner) must attend, and interested stakeholders may attend as well (but must remain silent observers). The meeting is timeboxed to 15 minutes, so all team members must show up on time. Every team member answers three questions: What have I done since the last Daily Scrum? What will I do between now and the next Daily Scrum? What obstacles and roadblocks are in my way? Each team member must be brief; if an answer requires discussion, the relevant team members schedule a follow-up for immediately after the meeting.
* Each sprint is timeboxed to a specific length decided during sprint planning: many teams use 30 calendar days, but this length can vary—some teams choose two-week sprints, some choose one month (and again, the planning timebox should vary accordingly). During the sprint, the team builds the items in the sprint backlog into working software. They can get help from people who are not on the team, but people who are not on the team cannot tell the team how to do their jobs, and must trust the team to deliver. If anyone on the team discovers partway through the sprint that they overcommitted or that they can add extra items, they need to make sure the Product Owner knows as soon as they realize the sprint is in danger. He’s the team member who can work with the users and stakeholders to reset their expectations, and use that information to adjust the sprint backlog to match the team’s actual capacity. And if they find that they’ll run out of work before the sprint ends, they can add more items to the sprint backlog. The team must keep the sprint backlog up to date and visible to every‐ one. In very abnormal cases and extreme circumstances, the Product Owner can terminate the sprint early and initiate new sprint planning if the team discovers that they cannot deliver working software (e.g., a serious technology, organiza‐ tional, or staffing issue comes up). But everyone needs to know that terminating the sprint is rare, and has an extremely negative cost in terms of their ability to produce and deliver software, and seriously impacts the trust that they’ve built up with their users and stakeholders.
* At the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review meeting where they demonstrate working software to users and stakeholders. The demo may only include items that are actually done done3 (which, in this case, means that the team has finished all work on it and tested it, and that it’s been accepted by the Product Owner as complete). The team can only present functional, working software, not intermediate items like architecture diagrams, database schemas, functional specs, etc. Stakeholders can ask questions, which the team can answer. At the end of the demo, the stakeholders are asked for their opinions and feed‐ back, and are given the opportunity to share their thoughts, feelings, ideas, and opinions. If changes are needed, that’s taken into account when the next sprint is planned. The Product Owner can add the changes to the product backlog, and if they need to be made immediately they’ll end up in the sprint backlog for the next sprint.
* After the sprint, the team holds a sprint retrospective meeting to find specific ways to improve how they work. The team and Scrum Master (and optionally the Product Owner) attend. Each person answers two questions: What went well during the sprint? What can improve in the future? The Scrum Master takes note of any improvements, and specific items (such as setting up a new build server, adopting a new programming practice, or changing the office layout) are added to the product backlog as nonfunctional items.

## Everyone on a Scrum Team Owns the Project
When the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and team start to work together instead of separately, the project begins to look more like Scrum.

### The Scrum Master Guides the Team’s Decisions
On a command-and-control project, the project manager is the owner and main‐ tainer of the schedule and plan. He talks to the stakeholders, gets the requirements, breaks down the work, obtains estimates from the team, assigns tasks, and builds out a schedule.

Team members on a command-and-control project have a natural CYA urge to wash their hands of project problems when they’re caused by someone else’s plan.

That’s one reason why Scrum doesn’t have a separate role for a person who owns the plan. So the Scrum Master doesn’t own the plan. He may help the team to create the plan. But more importantly, he guides the team’s use of Scrum and its practices, and helps everyone feel like they own the plan together.

### The Product Owner Helps the Team Understand the Value of the Software
On a Scrum team, the Product Owner is the person who made the commitment to the company. He’s the person who has to stand up and promise something specific that will be delivered at the end of the project. The Product Owner is keyed into the real business goals that the project is meant to fulfill. The more effectively he can get the team to understand those goals and feel committed to meeting them, the better the project will go. And when the project inevitably runs into trouble like technical problems, a change in the business, or people leaving the team, the Product Owner has to find a way to keep the team’s understanding of goals current, and keep up their feeling of commitment. He makes day-to-day decisions based on business changes, and meets with the team every day to make sure they understand how the backlog and the goals of the project are changing.

The Product Owner doesn’t just sit around and wait for the sprint to finish. The Product Owner’s job is to own and prioritize the backlog, to be the voice of the business to the team, to help them understand what stories and backlog items are most important and most valuable, and to make sure that everyone understands what it means to be done done with a backlog item.

The Product Owner has a very active day-to-day role in the project. The sprint planning that happens at the beginning of the sprint gives everyone enough information to get started, but that’s not nearly enough time for the Product Owner to communicate to the entire team all of the details about what they’ll be building. So during the sprint, the Product Owner works with all of the team members every single day, answering lots of detailed questions and giving them specific answers about what they’ll be building and how users will use the features they’re working on, as well as making lots of small decisions about how the product will work.

The Product Owner has the authority to make these decisions. (If he doesn’t, he’s the wrong person for the job! Scrum depends on the ability of the Product Owner to make decisions on behalf of the business, including accepting completed work.)

### Everyone Owns the Project
How many times have you, as a developer, chosen a technology for the project just because you want to learn it? As a project manager, have you chosen to work on agile projects because it makes you more marketable? Probably. We’ve all done this, at least a little bit. Everyone’s self-motivated, and it’s important to recognize that. But one thing that Scrum is asking you to do is: while you’re working on a sprint, making the project successful is more important than any other professional goal that you have. In other words, keep being a pig when you’re on a Scrum team, and not a chicken!

However, Scrum teams—and especially their Product Owners—cultivate relationships with their chickens (For example, every user is a potential chicken.). One of the most effective ways that they have to do this is to release working software to their users on a regular and predictable schedule. This keeps the chickens involved, and helps them see the influence that they have over the project.

#### How Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and team members can be better pigs
When a team member just does the tasks that are assigned to him by a project manager, but doesn’t feel like it’s really his problem when the plan runs into trouble, he’s acting like a chicken.

The sad truth is that many companies expect team members to act like chickens, and not pigs. In fact, programmers often find that when they try to get involved with planning the project they’re pushed away from the process, because planning and decision making is a privilege reserved for managers, not rank-and-file programmers.

It’s far too easy for a Scrum Master to inadvertently encourage the team to be chick‐ ens by becoming the owner—or 'keeper'—of the plan. This is a very difficult habit to break for a command-and-control project manager who’s learning to become a Scrum Master. When the Scrum Master breaks down the work for a sprint by himself, goes and gets estimates from the team, assigns work to them, and checks up on their status, he’s acting like the 'keeper' of the plan. He’s also encouraging them to be chickens instead of pigs.

Correcting a chicken attitude among the team is one of the most difficult barriers to Scrum adoption that Scrum Masters face. Teams often embrace the role of the command-and-control project manager because it takes the burden of having to think about the whole project off of their shoulders.

A Scrum Master can help encourage team members to be pigs by treating estimates as facts that have yet to be uncovered, not commitments to be wrung from the team. An estimate for a task is a fact because the team will spend a certain amount of time doing the work. The best estimates are real attempts to tell the truth about what will happen, not pie-in-the-sky, hopeful guesses that are used to please or placate a man‐ ager, or get out of the planning meeting faster.

Traditional project managers often see the plan as a way to motivate the team, and commit them to a deadline. They often see the plan as a way to get the team to do something, as if the team will just sit around doing nothing if not for the plan. A project manager that wrings aggressive estimates from the team and 'ratifies' them at the start of the sprint will often feel comfortable using the plan later to bully the team. This is why an attitude of “plan the work, work the plan” can create a fracture between the project man‐ ager and the team.

On an effective Scrum team, instead of demanding estimates and then holding each person accountable for them, the Scrum Master works with the whole team in order to discover each estimate—not just the individual person assigned to do each task. A Scrum Master and team who work together to do the best job they can of predicting what will happen, and who keep working together throughout the project to keep that picture as accurate as possible, will give themselves the time to do the best work they can—and will end up delivering more valuable software as a result.

Team members also feel more committed when they participate in assigning the work during a sprint planning session, rather than having the work assigned to them. In fact, if the team members really feel that sense of commitment, the assignments don’t even need to be made at the start of the sprint. Effective Scrum teams can decide during the sprint who will do which tasks, based on which people are available and the skills that they can bring to the task. This is one of the keys to understanding how self-organizing teams work.

This means that on effective Scrum teams, the team members don’t just commit to their individual tasks. Every single person feels a genuine commitment to delivering the most valuable software they can to their users and stakeholders. When everyone on the team shares this feeling, and agrees to deliver working software at the end of each sprint, we say that the team has made a **collective commitment**. Instead of committing to individual, micro-level tasks in a plan, the team is committed to delivering valuable items in the backlog.

## Scrum Has Its Own Set of Values
Self-organizing teams work differently than command-and-control teams because they have different values. Understanding self-organization starts with learning how the 5 scrum values are practical things that can be incorporated into your projects:
* Each person is **committed** to the project’s goals. That level of commitment can be achieved when the team has the authority to make decisions in order to meet those goals, and everyone has a say in how the project is planned and executed.
* Team members **respect** each other. When team members have mutual respect, they’re able to trust each other to do a good job with the work they’ve taken on. A good Scrum Master finds ways to increase the team members’ mutual respect for each other. For example, he may show the programmers that the Product Owner has a deep understanding of how the users think and what the company needs. As programmers start to understand how that knowledge is useful for the project to be successful, they start to value and respect the Product Owner’s opinions.
* Everyone is **focused** on the work. When a Scrum team member is working on a sprint, that’s his only job for the duration of the sprint.
* The teams value **openness**. When you’re working on a Scrum team, everyone else on the team should always be aware of what you’re working on and how it moves the project toward its current goals. Task boards, for example, allow everyone to see all of the work being done by each team member, and how much work is left to do. Burndown charts let each person gauge for him- or her‐ self how quickly the sprint is meeting its sprint goals. The Daily Scrum, when done effectively, is an almost pure exercise in openness, because each person shares his or her tasks, challenges, and progress for the whole team to see.
Many companies have a culture that discourages transparency, and replaces it with a rigid hierarchy that depends on opaqueness. Managers that establish a cul‐ ture like this benefit from it in several ways. It’s much easier in an opaque organi‐ zation to tell a team to meet an unrealistic goal (“I don’t care how you do it, just get it done!”), forcing the team to work overtime to meet it. And it gives the manager plausible deniability to CYA when the team inevitably fails to meet that goal (“It’s not my fault they screwed up!”).
* Team members have the **courage** to stand up for the project. When you choose openness over opaqueness, you make the team stronger, rather than making yourself stronger at the expense of the team. It takes courage to say to yourself, 'Helping this team produce valuable software is more important to me than bragging rights from my own personal contribution.'

## The Whole Team Uses the Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum does two very important things for the team. It functions as an inspection of the work that the team is doing, so they can adapt that work to deliver the most value. And it gives the team the opportunity to make decisions at the last responsible moment, giving them the flexibility to have the right person do the right work at the right time.

The daily scrum is *not* a status update meeting. It can function as a meeting to remove any blockers, but in essense, think of the daily scrum as a mini sprint planning. The team comes together to re-plan the sprint (if needed) to ensure the team is still on track to complete the sprint.

### Feedback and the Visibility-Inspection-Adaptation Cycle
The best way we have for users to judge whether or not the team is building valuable software is to put working software in their hands as frequently as possible. That’s called **visibility** (or transparency), and it applies to communication as well.

When the team members describe their work to each other in the same way every day, a lot of the problems that are caused by inevitable miscommunication get caught before they become costly (and caustic!). When everyone on the team **inspects** what everyone else is doing, they come to conclusions together and maintain a common understanding of the project’s goals and how they’re meeting them.

During the Daily Scrum, when one person describes what he’s working on, one of his teammates might have a suggestion for a way he can improve. If her suggestion is a good one, the work he does the next day will be better. She might also discover that he’s working on the wrong task entirely, a problem that’s most likely caused by mis‐ communication, which would also cause him to change his plans for the next day’s work. These changes are called adaptation. The daily cycle of visibility, inspection, and a **daptation** allows teams to continuously use feedback from their projects to improve how they build software. This is one of the most important features of Scrum. Scrum teams make decisions based on experience and on actual, known facts from their projects.

This cycle is an important **feedback loop** that the team can use to keep the project on track, and to make sure that everyone is communicating and on the same page.

### The Last Responsible Moment
Team members themselves are the source of the task assignments. Each person self-assigns her next task as soon as she’s done with the current one.

When a team that’s used to command-and-control management arrives for the Daily Scrum, they typi‐ cally look to the project manager or Scrum Master for guidance. That’s when he asks each of them for their status updates, and gives them their next assignments. This feels natural to a team used to having their assignments handed to them. An agile coach looking to help this team run more effective Daily Scrums might advise the Scrum Master, just this once, to stay silent. This will often lead to a minute or two of painful, awkward silence. Finally, someone will speak up and describe the work they did since the last meeting. If the team is lucky, the next thing that team member does is ask, 'So what’s my next task?'

This is the moment when the Scrum Master really distinguishes himself from a project manager. A project manager would proceed to hand the team member a pre- parceled task. The Scrum Master recognizes this as the chance for the team to have a collective 'a ha!' moment, when they finally figure out exactly where task assignments come from.

Also, instead of decomposing the work into tasks at the beginning of the sprint, sequencing the tasks, assigning each of them to team members before any work is started, and tracking to that plan, agile teams follow a simple rule for scheduling. They make all decisions at the **last responsible moment**.

### How to Hold an Effective Daily Scrum
1. Act like a 'pig'. Every team member is accountable to his or her teammates, and should explain what happened if a commitment that he or she made in the previous meeting wasn't met. The first thing that you get from the Daily Scrum: your next task. When it’s your turn to answer the question about what you’ll be doing between now and the next Daily Scrum, if you’ve finished all the work assigned to you so far, your job is to look at the tasks in the “to do” column and choose the one that makes the most sense for you and for the project. If it’s not the right choice, someone else who’s also acting like a genuinely committed 'pig' will speak up.
2. Take detailed conversations offline. The goal of the Daily Scrum is to identify problems, not solve them. If a problem hasn’t been resolved after a minute or two of discussion, schedule a follow-up meeting with anyone who feels they need to be involved.
3. Take turns going first. There’s no single person who’s the “keeper” of the schedule, and there's no single person who’s more important to the project than anyone else.
3. Don’t treat it like a ritual. It’s easy to treat the three questions that each person answers— What have I done since the last Daily Scrum? What will I do until the next one? What’s blocking my progress?—as a ritual that just needs to be adhered to for some reason everyone’s forgotten. Rituals tend to fade over time, because people see them as perfunctory. These questions are the core of the Daily Scrum because those are exactly the things that the team needs to inspect every day in order to find the project problems early.
4. Everyone participates. This includes testers, business analysts, and anyone else on the team—and the Product Owner, too. The Product Owner has an especially important job to do because he or she keeps everyone up to date on what tasks in the backlog are most valuable to the users and the company.
5. Don’t treat it like a status meeting. A status meeting is really just a one-way communication, a bunch of individual two-person conversations between a single team member and a project manager. You can avoid this by making sure that each person in the Daily Scrum is really listening.
6. Inspect every task. When you’re looking for roadblocks, don’t just look at what you’re currently doing. Look several moves ahead by examining every item in the “to do” column to figure out if any of those items could have an impact.
7. Change the plan if it needs to be changed. This is the 'adapting' part of the visibility-inspection-adaptation cycle, and it’s what puts the teeth in self-organization.

## Sprints, Planning, and Retrospectives
Sprint planning requires you—and your whole team—to think about what your users need, and what they value, in a way that you never have before. When people talk about Scrum being hard, this is generally what they’re referring to.

Luckily, effective Scrum teams have a not-so-secret weapon to attack this problem: the Product Owner. When the Product Owner really takes the time to understand what the stakeholders need and what will give them value, he can help the team aim each sprint at the problems that the company needs solved first.

And when the team is holding effective retrospectives at the end of each sprint, the Product Owner can help take the lessons the team learned back to the company so that everyone’s expectations can stay in line with what the team can actually deliver.

### Iterative or Incremental?
An iterative process is one that makes progress through successive refinement. A development team takes a first cut at a system, knowing it is incomplete or weak in some (perhaps many) areas. They then iteratively refine those areas until the product is satisfactory. With each iteration the software is improved through the addition of greater detail.

An incremental process is one in which software is built and delivered in pieces. Each piece, or increment, represents a complete subset of functionality. The increment may be either small or large, perhaps ranging from just a system’s login screen on the small end to a highly flexible set of data management screens. Each increment is fully coded and tested, and the common expectation is that the work of an iteration will not need to be revisited.

Scrum sprints are about more than just delivering working software on a timeboxed schedule. Scrum is also about understanding the value that the software delivers, looking at exactly how that value will be delivered, and changing course if there’s a way to deliver more value. When methodologies and processes like Scrum work like that, it’s called iterative development. That’s why Scrum is both an incremental and iterative methodology.

A Scrum team that’s doing incremental development takes the same visibility-inspection-adaptation cycle that they already use for their Daily Scrums and applies it to the project as a whole. That’s the goal of sprint planning, managing the sprint backlog, and holding retrospectives.

It’s the Product Owner’s job to:
* Understand what the company needs most, and bring that knowledge back to the team
* Understand what software features the team can potentially deliver
* Figure out which features are more valuable to the company, and which are less valuable
* Work with the team to figure out which features are easier to build, and which are harder
* Use that knowledge of value, difficulty, uncertainty, complexity, etc. to help the team choose the right features to build in each sprint
* Bring that knowledge back to the rest of the company, so they can do what they need to do to prepare for the next release of the software

### The Product Owner Makes or Breaks the Sprint
He or she owns the product backlog, and selects the highest priority items to ask the team to work on during the sprint. He works with the team during sprint planning to decide which of those items go into the sprint backlog (which is owned collectively by the team), and accepts those items that have been finished by the team on behalf of the company.

This means that the Product Owner has to have a lot of authority—and a Product Owner who doesn’t really have the authority to make those decisions (or who does, but is afraid to make them) is the wrong person for the job. It also means that the Product Owner has to have a really good sense of what’s valuable to the company. He or she can talk to other people to figure out what items are more or less valuable, but in the end it’s up to the Product Owner to make the final decision about the priority of everything in the product backlog.

#### Definition of 'Done'
PO and the team need to agree on what it means for each item to be “Done”—not just done, but “Done.” A backlog item is “Done” if it can be accepted by the Product Owner and delivered to the rest of the company. If each item doesn’t have a clear, unambiguous definition of what it means to be “Done,” there will be a lot of confusion and, almost certainly, heated arguments at the end of the sprint.

Any items that are not “Done” go back onto the product backlog—even if the team did a lot (or even most) of the work for them. The team don’t get credit for having finished the item until it’s actually “Done” and accepted by the Product Owner.

### Visibility and Value
When a team has a culture where the more experienced developer does the 'grunt work' in a few minutes when it’s fresh rather than making a more junior team member spend hours on it later, that can be another source of the Scrum 'hyper-productivity' and 'astonishing results' that seem to elude many teams. On a Scrum team, everyone has a genuine feeling of ownership for every aspect of the project. If the senior team member feels that way, it would never even occur to him to “dump” these tasks—and, in fact, it wouldn’t feel like dumping at all. He would be the logical person to do the work, so doing that work would feel like the most important thing for him to be doing right now.

So how do you get that feeling of shared ownership embedded in the team, so that every single person—from the most junior developer to the senior technical lead to the Scrum Master and Product Owner—will voluntarily take on uninteresting or irritating tasks because he or she cares about the project?

When teams are motivated effectively, it’s because they’re organized around an **elevating goal**. Elevating goals are aimed at value: software is valuable if it makes your users’ lives better.

All members of an agile team, even ones who don’t necessarily write code—are highly motivated by pride of workmanship. We want to build software that's useful, and that people like and care about.

### How to Plan and Run an Effective Scrum Sprint
1. Starting with the backlog — which means starting with the users. It's the PO's job to understand the users, and keep everyone on the team up to date on what they need most from the software.
2. Be realistic about what you can deliver. A good Scrum Master helps the team estimate the work and figure out what they can and can’t include.
3. Change the plan if it needs to change. Take advantage of the Daily Scrum meetings to figure out if the team is really going to finish everything they’ve promised for the sprint. If the plan needs to be changed, it’s the responsibility of the team to change it. If it becomes clear that the team won’t be able to finish all of the work in the sprint backlog, then the team should move some of it (starting with the lowest value items) out of the sprint backlog and back into the product backlog—and the Scrum Master should make sure that everyone on the team understands the change.
4. Get everyone talking about value. Effective Scrum teams tend to be full of people who understand what their users actually need, and what’s valuable to them. How does it make their lives easier? What does it let them do that they couldn’t do before? How much time and effort will it save them? These things really matter to agile developers. The more that you talk about them and make sure that they matter, the better the software will be.
