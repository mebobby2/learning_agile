# XP, Simplicity, and Incremental Design
The goals of XP go beyond simply getting the team to work better. The larger goal of XP—of its practices, values, and principles—is to help **teams build software that can be extended and changed easily**, and to help those teams work, plan, and grow together in an environment that accepts and embraces these changes.

## Code Smells and Antipatterns (or, How to Tell If You’re Being Too Clever)
**Simplicity** starts with knowing how not to do too much.

### XP Teams Look for Code Smells and Fix Them
Recognizing code antipatterns (called **code smell**) is the first step in stripping the complexity away from your codebase.
* Shotgun surgery - This is what happens when you attempt to make a small change to one part of the code, but find that it requires changes to, say, two or three more seemingly unrelated or barely related parts of the codebase.
* Half-baked code - Code smells half-baked when a programmer, in order to use one object (or module, unit, etc.), must also initialize other objects in a specific, prescribed way.
* Very large classes - When your code has very large classes (or, for non-object-oriented code, very large methods, or func‐ tions, or modules, etc.), it can be difficult to read and maintain. But more impor‐ tantly, it’s often an indication that it’s trying to do too many things, and can be separated out into smaller units that are easier to understand
* duplicated code - an identical (or almost identical) block of code that shows up in more than one place. This is a very likely source of bugs, especially if a programmer makes a change to three of the duplicates, but forgets to make that change to the fourth.
* Spaghetti code - Code that has a complex and tan‐ gled structure
* Lasagna code - Modern software design typically divides code into layers that each have a specific purpose or behavior that contributes to the whole design. However, when there are far too many layers, and those layers don’t necessarily have a coherent pat‐ tern to them, it gets difficult to understand exactly what any one layer is supposed to do. This can be compounded by **leaks** between layers, where code, types, or ideas that should be contained within one layer find their way into neighboring ones.

### Hooks, Edge Cases, and Code That Does Too Much
And effective XP developers understand that they need to be concerned with code behavior as much as code structure.
* Hooks - a placeholder to handle that future case. The hook seems 'free' (because there’s so little to it), but it really does have a cost: tying the team to a decision made today that could be put off until later.
* Edge cases - antipattern that can make code difficult to understand is obsessing over edge cases.
* Framework trap - The framework trap is what we call it when a devel‐ oper has to solve a single problem or perform a task, but instead of just writing code to do that one thing, he writes a larger framework that can be used in the future to solve similar problems or perform similar tasks.

## Make Code and Design Decisions at the Last Responsible Moment
Scrum teams use the idea of the last responsible moment to bring simplicity to project planning, and it helps increase productivity and lets teams make better decisions by avoiding project management antipatterns.

When it comes to planning the technical side of the project, XP teams do something very similar: they apply their core value of simplicity to architecture, design, and code. And just like Scrum teams, they do this by making decisions about architecture, design, and code at the last responsible moment. And much of the time, that moment happens after your code is written.

Does the idea of making code design decisions after the code is written seem odd? It doesn’t seem odd to an XP developer, because XP teams are constantly **refactoring** their code: changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior. Refac‐ toring isn’t unique to XP

### Fix Technical Debt by Refactoring Mercilessly
Poor software design and development adds up over time. This is called **technical debt**. An effective XP team leaves time in each cycle to “pay down” debt. This is a good way to use **slack**. XP teams **refactor mercilessly**, constantly smelling their code and looking for ways to simplify it through refactoring. When everyone on a team is in the habit of constantly refactoring, they build a codebase *that is much easier to change*.

### Use Continuous Integration to Find Design Problems
One reason that continu‐ ous integration improves design and prevents these design problems is that it allows the team to fail early when they introduce integration problems. A system that’s designed to immediately report a failure as soon as it happens is called a **fail-fast system**.

### Avoid Monolithic Design
**Monolithic design** is software design made up of large, interconnected units that have many interdependencies and are difficult to separate.

The most damaging thing you can do is write bad code, and then write more code that depends on it. Adding a dependency like that is sometimes called 'coupling'. Monolithic design often features **tightly coupled code**, where the typical unit has many connections to many other parts of the system. Trying to change highly coupled code is very frustrating—it’s often the coupling that leads to shotgun surgery and many other antipatterns.

Just as code can be coupled, it can also be **decoupled**, by breaking the connections between units (or, even better, by never adding those connections in the first place).

A system is easiest to maintain when it’s built with small, independent units: every part of the code is decoupled from every other part as much as is practically possible (which can be a surprising amount), so that there are very few dependencies between them. This is a major key to building a system that can be changed without a lot of rework. If your design is highly decoupled, then you’ll rarely find yourself performing shotgun surgery or making changes to many parts of the system for a single change.

## Incremental Design and the Holistic XP Practices
We talked about 10 of the 13 primary XP practices, dividing them into categories: programming, integration, planning, and team practices. There are three more primary XP practices, and we’ve come up with one more category for these three: holistic practices. We called them “holistic” because they are closely interconnected, and they don’t work on their own.

### Incremental Design
You can find great examples of incremental design in many mature, high-quality open source projects, such as Linux, Apache HTTP Server, and Firefox. These projects are all designed around a solid, stable core; developers use a plug-in architec‐ ture (or some other way of separating code from the core) to build additional fea tures, and only the most reused, most stable features are incorporated into the core. A design like this leads to highly decoupled code. The codebase grows incrementally over time; this is how a very large team distributed across many countries can build great software.

At its core, incremental design is about making code design decisions at the last responsible moment, avoiding one of the most common traps that developers—even advanced, highly skilled developers—fall into: trying to build everything at once.

### Teams Work Best When They Feel Like They Have Time to Think
**Energized work** means establishing an environment where every team member is given enough time and freedom to do the job. This keeps them in the mental space where they can develop and use good habits that lead to better, more naturally changeable code. This, in turn, lets them produce much more code, and deliver more valuable features (and features that are more valuable) to the users and customers, in a shorter period of time.

Disrespect, unrealistic artificial deadlines, and other bad behavior from the boss can lead to an **unenergized** environment, or a working environment where people don’t feel like they have the ability to make decisions, and don’t have the mental space to make good decisions or innovate.

### Team Members Trust Each Other and Make Decisions Together
The **whole team** practice is about helping the individuals on the team come together as a whole. When they encounter obstacles, they work together to overcome them. When there's an important decision that affects the direction of the project, that decision is made together. Everyone on the team learns to trust the rest of the team mem‐ bers to figure out which decisions can be made individually, and which decisions need to be brought to the rest of the team.

### Incremental Design Versus Designing for Reuse
How do they make the jump between implementing practices, and fundamentally changing the way they design and build software?
The key to getting into the XP mindset lies with incremental design.

An important tool for helping a team build a system using incremental design is to have a very simple contract between the units of that system. How do those units communicate with each other? Do they pass messages? Call functions or methods? Access services on the network? The more simple and consistent the unit-to-unit communication mechanism is, the easier it is for the team to add units.

So how do you make a contract simple? The same way you make units simple: make decisions about how units communicate at the last responsible moment. And we already have a tool to help with this: test-first programming. When a developer builds unit tests first, it helps her strip out complexity by forcing her to use that unit before it’s written. She can use the same unit testing tool or framework to write simple **integration tests** that test how multiple units communicate with each other—and she’ll write those tests before she adds the code to communicate.

The reason this helps keep the contract between units simple is that it becomes clear very quickly if that contract is complex. With a simple contract, this sort of integra‐ tion test is very easy to write. But when the contract is complex, the integration test is a burden: the developer will find herself having to initialize many different, seemingly unrelated objects, clumsily translating data from one format to another, and having to jump through hoops to get the units to communicate.

When a system is designed so that its behavior seems to emerge from the interactions between the individual units working together, in a way that doesn’t seem to originate from one single unit, it’s called **emergent design**. Systems built using emergent design almost always consist of small, independent, decoupled units. Those pieces are combined to perform complex tasks, and the behavior of the system comes as much from the interactions between those units as it does from the individual units themselves. There’s rarely a deep hierarchy of units calling other units; instead, the system will use messages, queues, or other ways for units to communicate without requiring a central control system.
