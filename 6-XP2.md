# XP, Simplicity, and Incremental Design
The goals of XP go beyond simply getting the team to work better. The larger goal of XP—of its practices, values, and principles—is to help **teams build software that can be extended and changed easily**, and to help those teams work, plan, and grow together in an environment that accepts and embraces these changes.

## Code Smells and Antipatterns (or, How to Tell If You’re Being Too Clever)
**Simplicity** starts with knowing how not to do too much.

### XP Teams Look for Code Smells and Fix Them
Recognizing code antipatterns (called **code smell**) is the first step in stripping the complexity away from your codebase.
* Shotgun surgery - This is what happens when you attempt to make a small change to one part of the code, but find that it requires changes to, say, two or three more seemingly unrelated or barely related parts of the codebase.
* Half-baked code - Code smells half-baked when a programmer, in order to use one object (or module, unit, etc.), must also initialize other objects in a specific, prescribed way.
* Very large classes - When your code has very large classes (or, for non-object-oriented code, very large methods, or func‐ tions, or modules, etc.), it can be difficult to read and maintain. But more impor‐ tantly, it’s often an indication that it’s trying to do too many things, and can be separated out into smaller units that are easier to understand
* duplicated code - an identical (or almost identical) block of code that shows up in more than one place. This is a very likely source of bugs, especially if a programmer makes a change to three of the duplicates, but forgets to make that change to the fourth.
* Spaghetti code - Code that has a complex and tan‐ gled structure
* Lasagna code - Modern software design typically divides code into layers that each have a specific purpose or behavior that contributes to the whole design. However, when there are far too many layers, and those layers don’t necessarily have a coherent pat‐ tern to them, it gets difficult to understand exactly what any one layer is supposed to do. This can be compounded by **leaks** between layers, where code, types, or ideas that should be contained within one layer find their way into neighboring ones.

### Hooks, Edge Cases, and Code That Does Too Much
And effective XP developers understand that they need to be concerned with code behavior as much as code structure.
* Hooks - a placeholder to handle that future case. The hook seems 'free' (because there’s so little to it), but it really does have a cost: tying the team to a decision made today that could be put off until later.
* Edge cases - antipattern that can make code difficult to understand is obsessing over edge cases.
* Framework trap - The framework trap is what we call it when a devel‐ oper has to solve a single problem or perform a task, but instead of just writing code to do that one thing, he writes a larger framework that can be used in the future to solve similar problems or perform similar tasks.
