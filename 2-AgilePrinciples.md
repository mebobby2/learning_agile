# Agile Principles

## The 12 Principles of Agile Software
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
5. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
6. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

The motivation behind the 12 principles: getting the team to build software that the user actually needs. The principles depend on the idea that we build projects to deliver value. But that word, 'value', is a little bit tricky, because everyone sees different value in the software.

For example: handheld ebook reader
* As a reader, you want the software to make the book easy to read. You care about being able to flip back and forth between pages, highlight sections or take notes, search for text, and keep track of the last page you read.
* As authors, we care very much that the words we write are displayed correctly, that these bullet points are indented so that they're easy for you to read, that it’s easy for you to navigate back and forth between the body text and the footnotes, and that you have a good overall experience so you can enjoy and learn from what we write.
* Our editor at O’Reilly cares that it’s easy to distribute the book to you, and that, if you like it, you have an easy way to give it a positive review and buy other books from O’Reilly.
* The bookseller or retailer who sold you this book wants to make it very easy for you to browse and buy other books they have for sale, and to download them quickly and easily to your reader.

It’s easy to see the value that an ebook reader has delivered, because hindsight is 20/20. It’s much harder to see that value at the start of the project.

### Principle 1
This first principle includes three distinct and important ideas: releasing software early, delivering value continuously, and satisfying the customer.

The customer can only give you real, informed feedback after seeing working software, then the best way to get that feedback is through **early delivery**. Because the software works, and because the customers can actually use it to do something they need, the team has delivered real value.

The downside to delivering early is that the software that’s first delivered to the customers is far from complete. This can be really hard for some users and stakeholders to deal with.

The core agile values have an answer to this: customer collaboration over contract negotiation. A team that's bound to a fixed specification with inflexible bureaucratic barriers to change doesn't have the option to let the software evolve over time. A team working under those conditions has to kick off a whole new change management process, which requires a fresh set of contract negotiations with the customer. On the other hand, a team that truly collaborates with the customers has the option of making all the necessary changes along the way. That's what **continuous delivery** means.

This is why agile methodologies are typically iterative. Agile teams plan the project’s iterations by choosing the features and requirements that will deliver the most value. The only way that the team can figure out what features deliver that value is to collab‐ orate with the customer and incorporate the feedback from the previous iteration. This lets the team satisfy the customer in the short run by demonstrating value early.

### Princple 2
Why are changes in a project emotionally charged? Understanding that is a key to this principle. A change is someone outside of the project telling you that some of the planning and work youd did was wrong—that you were wrong.

Most software engineers are driven by pride of workmanship: we want to deliver products that we can stand behind, and that satisfy our users’ needs. A change in a project threatens that, because it’s questioning the path that you’ve taken and the assumptions that you've made.

What does it mean to welcome change? It means:
* Nobody gets in “trouble” when there’s a change. We acknowledge—and our bosses acknowledge—that we’re human and fallible, and that it’s better for the company to allow us to make mistakes and correct them frequently, rather than expect us to do things perfectly the first time.
* We’re all in this together. Everyone on the team, including the customers you’re collaborating with, owns the requirements and the changes to those require‐ ments. If those requirements are wrong, it’s as much your fault as the customer’s, so there’s no sense in placing blame for a change.
* We don’t sit on change until it’s too late. Yes, it’s embarrassing to have made a mistake. But because we all recognize that, we simply do our best to fix it as early as possible. That way, the damage is limited.
* We stop thinking of changes as mistakes. We did our best with the information we had at the time, and it only became clear that we were wrong because the decisions we made along the way gave us the perspective to recognize the changes that we have to make today.
* We learn from the changes. This is the most effective way for a team to grow and get better at building software together.

### Principle 3
Agile practitioners refer to the traditional attitude toward project changes as **command-and-control**.

Command-and-control project management is similar to military command-and- control:
* 'Command' refers to the way the project manager assigns work to the team. The team may not report directly to her, but she has control over their assignments. She breaks down the work, builds a schedule, and assigns activities to the resour‐ ces on her team.
* 'Control' refers to the way she manages changes. Every project has changes along the way: work takes longer than anticipated, people take sick days or leave the project, hardware is not available or breaks, and all sorts of other unexpected things happen. Project managers constantly monitor for these changes, and then control the project by evaluating each change as it occurs, updating the plans to incorporate the change into the schedule and documentation, giving the team new assignments, and managing their stakeholders’ expectations so that nobody is blindsided.

If agile teams don’t use command-and-control, how do they manage to keep up with all of those changes?

The key to welcoming changes without introducing chaos lies in delivering working software frequently. The team uses iteration to break the project into regular dead‐ lines. During the iterations, the team delivers working software. At the end of each iteration, the team holds a demo to show the customer what they built, and a retro‐ spective to look back and see what lessons can be learned. Then they start a planning session to figure out what they’ll build in the next iteration. The predictable schedule and the constant checkpoints help the team catch those changes early, and give every‐ one a blame-free environment where they can discuss each change and come up with a strategy to incorporate it into the project.

The project manager’s role starts to shift away from command-and-control, where she gave the team a daily battle plan and constantly adjusted to keep them on track. Instead, now she’s working with the team to make sure that each person is constantly looking at the big picture and working toward the same goals. It’s easier to do that when the team is working on a short iteration that will deliver working software.
