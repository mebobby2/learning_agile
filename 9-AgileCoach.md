# The Agile Coach

Some teams are able to take a book on Scrum or XP, adopt the practices, and immediately see great results: those teams already have a mindset that’s compatible with the values and principles of the Agile manifesto and the methodology.

But what if you don’t already have a mindset that works for Scrum, XP, or another agile methodology? What if you’re working in an environment where it’s difficult to succeed with the agile values? What if individual contributions on your team are rewarded far more than team effort? What if mistakes are punished harshly? What if you’re in an environment that stifles innovation, or where your team has no access to the customers, users, or other people who can help you understand what software you’re building? These are all barriers to agile adoption.

This is where an **agile coach** comes in. An agile coach is someone who helps a team adopt agile. He or she will help each person on the team learn a new attitude and mindset, and get past the mental, emotional, and technical barriers that prevent the team from adopting an agile methodology.

The goal of the agile coach is to help the team attain a better, more agile mindset. A good coach helps the team choose a methodology that best fits their existing mindset, and introduces them to the values, principles, and practices of a methodology in a way that works for them. The coach will help the team adopt its practices, and then use those practices to help the team learn and internalize the values and principles, to slowly change their attitude, and to get into the right mindset so that they go beyond simply getting better-than-not-doing-it results.
