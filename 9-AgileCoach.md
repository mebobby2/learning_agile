# The Agile Coach

Some teams are able to take a book on Scrum or XP, adopt the practices, and immediately see great results: those teams already have a mindset that’s compatible with the values and principles of the Agile manifesto and the methodology.

But what if you don’t already have a mindset that works for Scrum, XP, or another agile methodology? What if you’re working in an environment where it’s difficult to succeed with the agile values? What if individual contributions on your team are rewarded far more than team effort? What if mistakes are punished harshly? What if you’re in an environment that stifles innovation, or where your team has no access to the customers, users, or other people who can help you understand what software you’re building? These are all barriers to agile adoption.

This is where an **agile coach** comes in. An agile coach is someone who helps a team adopt agile. He or she will help each person on the team learn a new attitude and mindset, and get past the mental, emotional, and technical barriers that prevent the team from adopting an agile methodology.

The goal of the agile coach is to help the team attain a better, more agile mindset. A good coach helps the team choose a methodology that best fits their existing mindset, and introduces them to the values, principles, and practices of a methodology in a way that works for them. The coach will help the team adopt its practices, and then use those practices to help the team learn and internalize the values and principles, to slowly change their attitude, and to get into the right mindset so that they go beyond simply getting better-than-not-doing-it results.

## Coaches Understand Why People Don’t Always Want to Change
This is something that every agile coach needs to keep in the front of his or her mind. The job of coaching is to help teams to change, and change can cause an outsized— but entirely rational—emotional response from the people being asked to change. Why? *Because work is how you pay for your life and feed your family*.

## Coaches Understand How People Learn
For example, let’s say that a developer discovers halfway through a sprint that a fea‐ ture won’t be finished, and at the next Daily Scrum he asks the Product Owner to push it to the next sprint. The Product Owner gets angry. She’s afraid that a customer or manager will get mad about this, and wants the developer to “do whatever it takes” to get it in—even if it means cutting corners and not finishing all of the code. There’s a shu-level answer to this problem: the rules of Scrum dictate that the team can only demo the feature at the sprint review if it’s “done done,” and incomplete work must be pushed into the next sprint. An agile coach understands the rules of Scrum, and can use them to resolve the conflict.

But a good agile coach also sees that there’s a ha-level teaching opportunity here. By recognizing a fractured perspective (like we learned about in Chapter 2) that can be “un-fractured,” the coach can help the Product Owner see things from the developer’s perspective—that doing poor work will add technical debt, and this will make the entire codebase more difficult to maintain. That technical debt, in turn, will cause future sprints to take longer. So while the Product Owner might end up getting the feature to a customer sooner by ignoring the Scrum rule, in the end she will be worse off because future development will go more slowly. This an important lesson that will help the Product Owner learn more about the Scrum value of focus, and how a team that focuses on completing work delivers a higher quality product more quickly.

The coach can also help the developer understand how important the feature is, and how it delivers value to the customers—and how in the future, a better understanding of value can help the developer work more closely with the Product Owner to find a way to break features into smaller ones and deliver more value to the customers sooner. This is an important lesson that will help the developer learn more about the Scrum value of commitment, and that a team can be more effective when they really understand what’s valuable to the customers and users.

## Coaches Understand What Makes a Methodology Work
So in the example above, how did the coach know that there was an opportunity in this particular conflict to teach the team about the Scrum values of focus and commitment? What was it about this particular problem that the coach recognized?

The coach recognized the opportunity because he understands not just how Scrum teams use iteration, but why they use it. He knows that a timeboxed iteration can be rendered completely ineffective if the team is allowed to include work that isn’t “done done.” Without that rule, iterations turn into simple project milestones: the scope of each iteration becomes more and more variable, and the team no longer has to deliver working software at the end of each iteration.

This breaks several important values and principles that make agile work. For exam‐ ple, the coach knows that working software is the primary measure of progress, and delivering incomplete software at the end of a sprint gives the customers and users a false measure of that progress. The coach also knows that agile teams value customer collaboration—but he also understands that customer collaboration doesn’t mean that the customer is always right. It means that if the team recognizes that there is a real problem with the plan, they can collaborate with the customer to come up with a solution that delivers the most value. He recognizes that if the customer and Product Owner can pressure developers to include software that isn’t complete in a sprint review, the team will become more guarded about the true progress of the work, and eventually customer collaboration will give way to contract negotiation between the team and the customer.

The coach knows all of this because he understands the values and principles of agile and Scrum, and knows how those values and principles drive the practices. He recog‐ nizes what makes the methodologies “tick.” A Scrum coach understands collective commitment and self-organization. An XP coach understands embracing change and incremental design. A Kanban coach understands how improving the team’s process requires setting WIP limits and using them to control the flow of work—and that when someone tries to prevent those WIP limits from getting set, the entire methodology unravels.
