# Agile Values

## Waterfall Process
A team following a waterfall process tries to write down as early as possible a complete description of the software that will be built. Once all of the users, managers, and executives agree on exactly what the software must do (the requirements), they can hand a document that contains those requirements (the specification) to a development team, and that team will go off and build exactly what’s written. Then a testing team comes in afterward, and verifies that the software matches the document. Many agile practitioners refer to this as “big requirements up front” (sometimes abbreviated BRUF).

The waterfall process made it difficult to respond to change because of the focus on documentation rather than collaboration. In a perfect world, the waterfall process would work just fine, because at the start of the project everyone would know exactly what they’d need at the end. That way, they could write it all down in a neat spec and hand it off to the team to build. But real-life projects never seemed to work out that way.

Teams that make waterfall work do it by adopting effective software practices and principles, especially ones that improve communication.

## A Fractured Perspective
Teams adopting agile practices, such as user stories, iterations, TDD etc can still run into problems: developers making incorrect assumptions, jumping into programming, and having to make changes to the code that could have been avoided, and that leave it more fragile.

In a fractured agile adoption, each person uses only the practices that impact his or her work. Developers concentrate on, say, test-driven development, refactoring, and automated builds. Project manag‐ ers like task boards, project velocity, and burndown charts. Business users use release planning and user stories to get a better grasp on what the team is doing. Team leads use daily standups and retrospectives to manage and improve the team. Everybody wants something different from the project, and they each see a few practices that do something specific to help them.

Now, adopting those practices individually will definitely improve things, because agile practices are really good. The problem is that because everyone—developers, project managers, business users, and team leads—sees the project from a different perspective, they’ll concentrate on only those practices that immediately appeal to them. There’s a paradoxical effect, where each person now sees only the part of agile that affects his specific project work, and draws the conclusion that agile is all about getting everyone else to come around to his point of view.

A team whose members only see the practices and don’t think about the principles will miss out on the important interactions between people. Their perspective stays fractured; the team members stay separate, and don’t really function as an effective unit. They’ll still get their work done, but they miss out on the great team interactions and collaboration that make agile really powerful.

## The Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto contains four simple values:
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Individuals and interactions
Means the team should focus on the people on the team and how they communicate first, and the tools and practices that they use second.

It’s not enough to have the 'correct' process or 'best' practice. If the people who need to use a process or tool don't buy into it, it will fall by the wayside— or, even worse, people will follow the letter of the process, even if it leads to incoherent results.

There are many agile practices that support this principle, across lots of different ways of thinking about agile. That’s why you’ll see practices that support individuals and interactions—like daily standup meetings and retrospectives. And user stories, too—the stories themselves are less impor‐ tant than the fact that they help the team have a conversation about what the story means.

### Working Software
Means that delivering software that does what users need is more important than delivering a specification that describes it.

The term 'working software' may seem vague. To an agile practitioner, working software is software that adds value to the organization. It could be software that a company sells to make money, or it could be software that people who work at the company use to do their jobs more efficiently.

Valuing working software over comprehensive documentation does not mean that you should not document. Documentation that helps the team understand the problem, communicate it with the users, and correct problems before they make it into the software is documentation that saves more time and effort than it costs.

### Customer Collaboration
Means treating everyone like they’re on the same team.

When programmers, testers, business owners, and project managers all work on different teams, and don’t really collaborate toward a single goal of delivering working software, they often treat each other as if they’re working on a contract.

This may reduce the risk of getting in trouble with the boss (because it makes it easier to point a finger and blame another team for failing to deliver software), but it is highly counterproductive if the goal is to get working software out the door for the users. A developer who is constantly trying to protect himself will be less able to try new ways to collaborate and innovate with the people who need to use the software being built.

One way agile teams put this value in place is to have a product owner. Treat the product owner as a member of the project team to collaborate with, rather than a client or customer to negotiate with.

### Responding to Change
Means recognizing that plans become inaccurate, and that it’s more important to deliver the software than it is to work the plan.

Teams need to constantly look for changes, and to make sure that they respond appropriately when there’s a change in what the users need, or in how the software needs to be built. If the circumstances change, the project needs a new plan.

A task board is a good example of a practice that helps a team make the right deci‐ sions about responding to changes. A task board can also be managed with a computer program, but many teams find it more effective to physically put it on a wall because standing in front of the board, talking, gesturing, and moving stories is a much richer form of communication than simply talking.  The board is set up in a way that anyone can rearrange the order of tasks, and is even encouraged to do so. If changes happen, everyone is encouraged to add index cards to the task board, rather than having to clear each change through a single project manager hub. This helps keep everyone in the loop on changes, so the plan doesn’t get stale.

## Principles Over Practices
A team that uses the agile practices to help attain the goal of building working software that customers value through interaction, collaboration, and responding to change will get more out of their projects than the team that simply adopts the better planning, programming, and documentation practices.

## Agile Methodologies
An agile methodology is a collection of practices combined with ideas, advice, and often a body of knowledge and wealth of experience among agile practitioners. Each methodology was developed and improved over the years by agile experts focused on all of the different parts of agile. Adopting a methodology in full means you’ll be following a tried-and-true path that takes you from the begin‐ ning to the end of a software project, without the trial and error that can lead to a fractured perspective.

### SCRUM
1. The product owner creates and maintains a **product backlog**, a list of requirements for the software.
2. The team runs timeboxed month-long **sprints**, where they pull a month’s worth of requirements from the product backlog to build, test, and demo. The require‐ ments for the current sprint are called the **sprint backlog**.
3. The team meets for a **daily standup meeting** in which everyone talks through the work they did the day before, the work they plan to do today, and any obstacles in their way.
4. The Scrum Master acts as leader, coach, and shepherd to guide the team through the project and remove obstables in the standup meeting.

But adopting Scrum requires more than just adopting those great practices. Every one of those practices could potentially be used in a way that doesn’t reflect the values and principles of agile. A daily standup, for example, works very well if the team uses it to collaborate and work together to move the project forward. But it could also be a meeting where a project manager informs the team of their individual assignments and gets status updates from each of them, one at a time. And each developer uses the meeting to tell the project manager, 'Here are obstacles blocking my way—you go deal with them.' If each person clings to his role—'That’s your responsibility, not mine!'—he starts to treat each new obstacle as someone else's problem. The meeting turns into a contract-like negotiation, instead of an opportunity for collaboration. A team that falls into this trap may have adopted Scrum-like practices, but they aren’t using Scrum.

### eXtreme Programming
Using simultaneous phases, an XP team produces deployable software every week. In each iteration, the team analyzes, designs, codes, tests, and deploys a subset of features. XP prescribes specific development practices aimed at improving collaborating with users, planning, developing, and testing.

### Lean and Kanban
Lean is not a methodology. Rather, it’s a name for a mindset—it has its own set of values, and thinking tools to help you adopt it. Lean is just as important in the agile world as XP and Scrum, and you can learn a lot about what it means to be agile by understanding what’s common among all three of them. Kanban is an agile method for improving the way that a team builds software. It’s built on the values of Lean, and it includes its own practices to help a team improve and evolve.

All these methodologies have entirely different focus and practices, but they are based on the same principles, and that is they rely on everyone on the team to work together and collectively own every aspect of the project. The values and principles of the Agile Manifesto are what tie all methodologies and methods together.
