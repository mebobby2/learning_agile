# Agile Values

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

A set of four core values that are common to successful teams and their projects

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

## Waterfall Process
A team following a waterfall process tries to write down as early as possible a complete description of the software that will be built. Once all of the users, managers, and executives agree on exactly what the software must do (the requirements), they can hand a document that contains those requirements (the specification) to a development team, and that team will go off and build exactly what’s written. Then a testing team comes in afterward, and verifies that the software matches the document. Many agile practitioners refer to this as “big requirements up front” (sometimes abbreviated BRUF).

The waterfall process made it difficult to respond to change because of the focus on documentation rather than collaboration. In a perfect world, the waterfall process would work just fine, because at the start of the project everyone would know exactly what they’d need at the end. That way, they could write it all down in a neat spec and hand it off to the team to build. But real-life projects never seemed to work out that way.

Teams that make waterfall work do it by adopting effective soft‐ ware practices and principles, especially ones that improve communication.

## A Fractured Perspective
Teams adopting agile practices, such as user stories, iterations, TDD etc can still run into problems: developers making incorrect assumptions, jumping into programming, and having to make changes to the code that could have been avoided, and that leave it more fragile.

When each person thinks only about his role and that one particular way the user story helps him, and doesn’t look past it to see how the entire team uses the user story —or any other agile tool, technique, or practice—it can cause exactly the kind of problem described above. We call this a fractured perspective, because everyone has a different view of the agile practice.
